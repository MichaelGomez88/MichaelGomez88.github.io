            <p>Our first date, kind of lol (It was). I really liked the day there. I remember you talking about your relationship with each of your siblings and then going into how you felt about them all. It was really windy, and we were at Redhill. You could barely look at me but it was still nice to listen and observe.</p>

            <p>Our first (second) date that we had at Chilis + first kiss at Frisbie Park. I remember it was still a little cold and chilly billy that day too, you even equipped the (neenie) beanie to withstand the coldness. Of course, I never get cold... Also I'm sorry, I look a little chopped in this but it's one of our few photos together.</p>

            <p>The first boink. I mean it was a lot more than that but I just thought it was super memorable... you even gave a super giant heartfelt message about it! I chose this picture here because I really like to way you look in it. I feel like you barely look at me (IM NOT THAT UGLY!!!) but I think it was the one time that I couldn't see it, I thought it was nice.</p>

            <p>VALENTINE'S DAY!!! I loved everything about this day. It was so nice to see the book you had made and the little ribbon that came with it. I was a HUGE fan of it all. Thank you for the work you put into that. This was also the first time we said the love word + squirting incident of '25</p>
